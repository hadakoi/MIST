## [File Provided](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/fbeb5f9040d62b18878d199cdda2d253/flag.png)

**Description:-**  What do the flags mean? <br>

**Hint:-**  The flag is in the format PICOCTF{} <br>

## Steps 


``` 
Upon downloading the file and opening it we can see multiple designs ligned up in a row and from the hint we can assume they represent our PICOCTF code as they also include curly brackets as seen much below
hence a quick reverse image search we can see that these are naval flags.

From this we can tell our PicoCTF flag is infact -> PICOCTF{F1AG5AND5TUFF}
