**Description:-**  A second message has come in the mail, and it seems almost identical to the first one. Maybe the same thing will work again. <br>

**Hint:-**  Try a frequency attack and Do the punctuation and the individual words help you make any substitutions? <br>

## Steps 

``` 
when opening the txt document given to us to  download we are given a very long cypher with what seems to be our flag at the end.
As in the hints it is given to us with regards to using a frequency attack and the punctuations and individual words that have repeated we can tell that they have used a mono alphabetic substitution in which we can use an online solver that will find the most likely substitutions for the letters to decrypt the cypher. (Thankyou chatgpt for the pointer)

hence our key recieved is PICOCTF{FR3JU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_6E0659FB}

and yes frequency attacks are infact cool.
